  dialogueSet1:
  - Hello!
  - Welcome to your new job at [Insert Company Here].
  - We hope you enjoy your stay, and unlimited PTO!
  - "What\u2019s that? Timer? What timer? I don\u2019t see a timer."
  - "You have a lot of work to do. So I recommend you put those kinds of thoughts
    out of your head while you\u2019re on company time."
  - And send any timer related complaints to HR.
  - "No, we don\u2019t have anyone in HR here right now, why do you ask?\r"
  - "Anyway,  if you need anything, I\u2019ll be right here.\r"
  - Literally.
  - "New company policy states all new hires need their computer continually monitored
    24/7 by a senior worker.\r"
  - "So I\u2019ll be seeing you, then! Always."
  dialogueSet2:
  - "How\u2019s work going?"
  - "Just kidding, I already know.\r"
  - "Your productivity is a little bit down from the average\u2026\r"
  - "I\u2019d keep an eye on it, you don\u2019t want to get in trouble with the boss.\r"
  - "Have you visited his office in the back yet?\r"
  - "I\u2019d say hi\u2026you don\u2019t want to be a stranger when quarterly reviews
    come back.\r"
  - "That\u2019s way more important than anything about that timer that you keep
    looking at.\r"
  - "That still doesn\u2019t exist.\r"
  - Back to work for you then!
  dialogueSet3:
  - "You may notice some small changes throughout the office, but don't worry. They
    won\u2019t affect your productivity.\r"
  - "But you wasting time talking to me will.\r"
  - "Your tasks are starting to pile up, you should do something about that.\r"
  - "Your tasks are starting to pile up, you should do something about that.\r"
  - "And ignore anything that may or may not come flying through the windows. That\u2019ll
    only distract you from your work."
  - Those are problems for out there, and you need to be focused on the problems
    in here.
  dialogueSet4:
  - "Small power outage, nothing to worry about. Won\u2019t affect productivity.\r"
  - "And I thought I told you to stop looking at that timer.\r"
  - "The one that doesn\u2019t exist, that is."
  - "Nothing will happen when it reaches zero.\r"
  - "But you need to get back to work before I write you up!\r"
  - "Your shift is nearly over. If there\u2019s anything you want to do I suggest
    you get to it soon.\r\n"
  - "I know you have a lot of things on your mind, but I promise nothing could matter
    more than the work you are doing here today.\r"
