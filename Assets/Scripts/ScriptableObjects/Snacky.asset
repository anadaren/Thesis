  dialogueSet1:
  - "Aghhhh don\u2019t bother me, I'm on my break."
  - "Don\u2019t ask me about that timer, it'll finish counting down before my break
    ends, so not my problem."
  dialogueSet2:
  - Not now, I'm on break.
  - I work 27 hours a day, I should get an uninterrupted break.
  dialogueSet3:
  - Mannnnn that severed head over there is none of my business. I'm on break.
  - "You think that\u2019s bad? That\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ve had this job for 71
    years, I\u2019ve seen some things."
  - "Just wait until you hear about the arm of \u201891, now THAT was gruesome."
  - Sometimes heads just fly through windows, nothing worth interrupting my break
    about.
  - "It\u2019ll all blow over by tomorrow."
  dialogueSet4:
  - Now that power's out?? Jeeeeez what's a guy gotta do to get a decent break around
    here.
  - "I told you, I don\u2019t care about any stupid timer, I\u2019m on break.\r"
  - "That\u2019s the last thing I\u2019ll say about it. If I die at least it\u2019ll
    be on my break."
