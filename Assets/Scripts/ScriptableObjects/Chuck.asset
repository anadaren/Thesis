  dialogueSet1:
  - You know, I have a new startup idea.
  - "A new social media website that sends slime directly to your friends home every
    time you like their post.\r"
  - "I\u2019ll call it Slimr."
  - "I\u2019m still working out the bugs, but I think it'll really blow up."
  dialogueSet2:
  - My startup isn't going so well.
  - "Apparently it\u2019s a \u201Cbad idea\u201D but what do other people know anyway?"
  dialogueSet3:
  - That's it! New startup idea--a severed head tracker.
  - "An app that\u2019ll alert you right before a severed head comes careening through
    your workplace."
  - Never be caught off guard again!
  - "It\u2019s perfect. If you get in now I\u2019ll give you 1% of the future revenue!"
  - "Insensitive? How do you mean?\r"
  dialogueSet4:
  - Things are kind of scary right now.
  - "Now\u2019s probably a good time to get into the big-timer-demolition industry."
  - "And as soon as my startup takes off, I\u2019ll be in the clear, disaster or
    not."
  - "Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t forget the people that helped along the way!"
  - "I\u2019ll be sure to tag you in all my posts about my humble beginnings."
