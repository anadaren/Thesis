  dialogueSet1:
  - "You know, I think the timer is a message.\r"
  - "I know we\u2019re not supposed to talk about it, but whatever, I\u2019m kind
    of a rebel."
  - "Anyway, I think it\u2019s a sign that we all need to stop all of what\u2019s
    happening in the world."
  - We have to return to our divine energies and go back to worshiping nature, the
    way humans are supposed to.
  - "That\u2019s all we have to do!"
  - "Anyway that\u2019s why I\u2019m not vaccinated."
  dialogueSet2:
  - You know, I really do love working here. Spreadsheets get me into the creative
    flow.
  - "Reminds me of when I went backpacking through Canada last year.\r"
  - I got really in touch with my inner self. Especially when all the locals threw
    things at me and told me to leave.
  - I love seeing how different people live.
  - I guess you could say I had a spiritual awakening or something.
  - "I feel so much more enlightened since I got back. I\u2019m so much better at
    spreadsheets now you would not believe."
  dialogueSet3:
  - I saw the severed head that fell through the window.
  - "Ugh, I feel so overwhelmed with everything that\u2019s happening. I need a meditation
    break."
  - ...
  - ...
  - Wow. I feel so much better now. You should try doing that
  - You'll forget all about that head and that silly old timer.
  - Namaste, bud.
  dialogueSet4:
  - "You know, I\u2019m not scared of the timer. It\u2019s just a big clock, I don\u2019t
    see what the big deal is."
  - As long as we're all in touch with our inner selves everything will be just fine.
  - "I was at my yoga studio last weekend and Bethany told me that we could solve
    all the world\u2019s problems if only we could get our own internal conflicts
    resolved.\r"
  - "I think she was onto something with that. Maybe the real timer is just in our
    minds. And in my mind, it\u2019s harmless, so I\u2019m not worried.\r"
  - Annnnnd if we do all die, maybe it was just our time, you know?
  - Maybe the earth needs a good cleansing!
